# Tiny Compiler Project - Rust

I really liked my compiler class. Specifically all of the CS problems: with
tokenizing, holding IR, and finally optimizing.This project is me giving all
of the concepts another try now that I know the end goal - and I am a better
programmer than before.

Based off of the tiny language because I threw away the spec of class project.
